# Introduction

Median filtering is a popular technique used to remove noise from a data set in preparation for further processing. This technique is particularly effective for data sets with a high level of noise, as it replaces each data item with the median value of its neighboring entries. While this technique is simple and effective, the process of computing the median can be computationally expensive. In this assignment, we will parallelize the median filter operation using the Java Fork/Join framework to improve performance.

# Approach

To parallelize the median filter operation, we will use a divide-and-conquer algorithm. The algorithm works by recursively dividing the input data set into smaller subsets until each subset contains only one element. Once the subsets have been created, we can calculate the median of each subset in parallel using multiple threads. Finally, we will combine the median values of each subset to produce the output data set.

In our implementation, we will use the Java Fork/Join framework to manage the parallel processing. This framework provides a simple way to divide the work across multiple threads and to synchronize the results. We will also experiment with different parameters to establish the limits at which sequential processing should begin.

# Experimental Evaluation

We will evaluate our program experimentally by measuring the run times of our serial and parallel methods using high-precision timing. We will test our implementation across a range of input sizes and filter sizes to determine the performance characteristics of our implementation.

To ensure the correctness of our implementation, we will compare the output of our parallel method with the output of our serial method for each test case. We will also perform additional tests to verify the correctness of our implementation.

# Results

Our experimental results show that the parallel implementation of the median filter operation provides a significant speedup over the serial implementation. The performance improvement is particularly significant for larger data sets and filter sizes. We also found that the performance of the parallel implementation depends on several factors, including the number of threads used and the size of the input data set.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we have successfully parallelized the median filter operation using the Java Fork/Join framework. Our experimental results demonstrate that our parallel implementation provides a significant speedup over the serial implementation for a wide range of input sizes and filter sizes. We also identified several factors that can affect the performance of our implementation, and we experimented with different parameters to optimize performance. Our implementation provides a useful tool for preprocessing data sets with a high level of noise, and our results demonstrate the importance of parallelization for computationally expensive tasks.
